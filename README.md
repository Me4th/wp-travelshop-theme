#### What is it not?
* it's not the pressmind's truetravel source, it's just an integration example for the pressmind® web-core sdk
* a full featured, plug & play travelshop
* it's not a booking engine, but you can integrate your own booking engine, or you can use the pressmind® IB3 booking engine

#### What is it?
* a good starting point for developing a WordPress based travelshop based on the pressmind® PIM
* the travelshop matches the german tour-operator market

#### For Freelance Web-Developers & Agencies
If you're planning a travelshop for german (DACH) tour-operators, it's possible to use this theme as a starting point for your project.
Keep in mind that you need pressmind®, so you do not build or integrate complex booking technology.

In most cases this is the basic setup for each travelshop:
* pressmind® Professional (PIM-System for tour-operators)
* pressmind® IB3 (seamless booking engine, with connectors to a lot of german tour-operator Systems like BusPro, Blank, DaVinci, TouPac, turista 2/3, STADIS)
* pressmind® web-core SDK or this theme

* list by the media object default list route by GET params
* list by shortcodes
* list by the default pressmind sdk framework
