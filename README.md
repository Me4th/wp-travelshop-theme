# WordPress travelshop theme
This is a responsive travelshop theme for WordPress.
The frontend is based on pure bootstrap components and a few common web libraries.
The backend is based on the pressmind® PIM system and the [pressmind® SDK](https://github.com/pressmind/sdk).
This theme is the perfect starting point in order to build professional travelshops.

### Additional information
#### What is it not?
* A full featured, plug & play travelshop.
* It is not a booking engine, but you can integrate your own booking engine or you can use the pressmind® IB3 booking engine.

#### What is it?
* A good starting point for developing a WordPress based travelshop based on the pressmind® PIM.
* The travelshop matches the german tour operator market.

#### For developers
If you are planning a travelshop for german (DACH) tour operators, it is possible to use this theme as a starting point for your project.
Keep in mind that you need pressmind®, so you do not build or integrate complex booking technology.

In most cases, this is the basic setup for each travelshop:
* pressmind® Professional (PIM-System for tour operators) see [pressmind.de](https://www.pressmind.de)
* pressmind® IB3 (seamless booking engine, with connectors to a lot of german tour operator systems like BusPro, Blank, DaVinci, TouPac, turista 2/3, STADIS)
* [pressmind® SDK](https://github.com/pressmind/sdk) or this theme
* for custom ux design take also a look at [Google UX Playbook for travel](https://services.google.com/fh/files/events/pdf_travel_ux_playbook.pdf)

### Features
* Display different tourism based products (packages, hotels, round trips, day trips, etc.)
* List products in a defined order
* Search products by defined attributes
* Search by travel date
* Search by duration range
* Search by price range
* Search by text (with auto-complete suggestions)
* Display cheapest available price
* Display bookable content, delivered by tour operator systems
* Fav-List feature
* Link to an external IBE like pressmind IB3
* Image handling: Thumbnailer, optimization
* Amazon S3 support

* ... and many more

#### Quick dev question:<br> How to generate product lists (based on pressmind® PIM)? 
It is possible to output product listings on four different ways:

* list by the media object list route using ($_GET)
* list by [shortcodes](./docs/readme-shortcodes.md)
* list programmatically with the pressmind SDK framework, take a look here: [QueryString API](./docs/readme-querystring-api.md)
* list with a beaverbuilder module (if enabled) (see [beaverbuilder integration](./docs/readme-beaverbuilder.md))
