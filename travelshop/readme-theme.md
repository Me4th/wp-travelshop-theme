# Travelshop theme

## The whole concept
This theme is an example theme for building an enterprise ready travelshop.
It is just a basic boilerplate for creating awesome travelshops based 
on the pressmind® PIM-System. 

## Booking engine 
A booking engine is not included in the theme, but there are two different ways to include a booking engine:

1. Integrate your own booking engine.
2. Use the pressmind® IB3 Booking Engine to connect many customer reservation systems 
(mostly based on the german market, like Kuschick, Bewotec, Blank, turista).
3. If you need a simple booking solution, have a look on the pressmind IB3 Engine. It can also handle 
bookings without a connected crs system in your backoffice.


## The template concept

Speed fst:
1. All WordPress related overload is removed:
(disabled functions: rest_output_link_wp_head, wp_oembed_add_discovery_links, 
rest_output_link_header, rsd_link,wlwmanifest_link, wp_shortlink_wp_head,wp_generator, emojis, etc.)

2. SASS Style, splitted in granular components to build critical path css on a smart way

3. Bootstrap

4. Less JS Frameworks, more pure JS

5. All JS is loaded in the footer

6. WEBP Support

7. Theme for Pros. Less WordPress admin pages, all settings are configured in config files.

## High availability (HA)
It is possible to use this theme for high traffic and availability setups (e.g. AWS, Google, Kubernetes). 
Ask your pressmind team for further information.
(Do not use wordpress plugins - please contact us for further questions.)
 
## Caching
The theme is ready for redis object caching (based on PECL phpredis). It is also possible to use
the pressmind `advanced_cache.php` dropin. For further information ask your pressmind integration manager.
Do not use an other page cache (They are not able to handle pressmind product pages.)

## Amazon S3 
It is possible to store all assets (WordPress media library and the pressmind product images on Amazon S3 storage).
Use the `pressmind S3 Stateless` Plugin for this case.
Do not use an other S3 plugin (They are not able to handle pressmind product pages.)

## SEO Topics

### Headings
Heading hierachy is on most pages present, but please check this based on real world content and modify it by yourself.

### Metadata for product descriptions
All pressmind® media object related pages have title and meta descriptions.
Each title and description can modified directly in the pressmind® PIM application.

**How to edit the generation pattern?**

For **media object detail pages**, see:
```text
config-routing.php:ts_detail_hook()
````

For **media media object default routes**, see:
```text
config-routing.php:ts_search_hook()
````

### Metadata for WordPress posttypes
There is a simple meta description feature included. It's just a sample. See
themes/travelshop/functions/add_meta.php how it works.


### Sitemap
Since 5.5, WordPress has a build in sitemap feature, so
no additional plugins are needed.
The travelshop theme removes unrelated sitemaps like users, categories and 
adds a sitemap for each pressmind related media object type.


### Custom url generation for products
The url generation pattern is based on a defined list of media object values.

See pm-config.php for configuration:
````php
 'media_types_pretty_url' => [
    607 => [
        'prefix' => '/travel/',
        'separator' => '-',
        'fields' => [
            'name',
            'id',
            'destination_default'
        ],
        'strategy' => 'unique',
        'suffix' => '/',
    ],
 ],
 
// generates this: https://www.domain/travel/special-roundtrip-12345-italy/
````
